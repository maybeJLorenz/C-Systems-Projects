# C Systems Programming Projects ⚙️ 👩‍💻 🛠️

This repository is a collection of **C/C++ projects** from my 2nd and 3rd year courses @ UCSC 🐌🌲 Some classes include **CSE13s** (Systems programming) and **CSE101** (Data structures).  
Each project demonstrates skills in **low-level programming, memory management, algorithms, and modular design**.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Huffman File Compression System (separate repo)
- **Description:** Implemented a lossless file compression/decompression utility using Huffman coding.  
- **Key Skills:** Binary trees, priority queues, bit-level file I/O, memory management, Makefile, Valgrind.  
- **Go to Repo:** [huffman-compression-c](https://github.com/maybeJLorenz/C-Systems-Projects/tree/main/Huffman%20File%20Compression%20System)
