# Huffman File Compression System

A lossless file compression and decompression utility implemented in **C** using **Huffman coding**.  
This project demonstrates **low-level systems programming** with custom bit-level I/O, binary trees, and priority queues to efficiently encode and decode data.  

---

## üìñ Overview
- **Compressor (`huff`)**: Reads a file, builds a frequency histogram, constructs a Huffman tree, and outputs a compressed binary file.  
- **Decompressor (`dehuff`)**: Reads the compressed binary file, reconstructs the Huffman tree, and restores the original file.  
- **Supporting Modules**:  
  - `bitwriter.c / bitreader.c`: Custom bit-level I/O operations  
  - `node.c`: Binary tree structure for code representation  
  - `pq.c`: Priority queue for tree construction  
- **Build System**: Makefile-based with unit tests and system tests.
